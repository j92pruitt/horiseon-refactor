# Horiseon Refactor

https://j92pruitt.github.io/horiseon-refactor/

## Description

A refactoring of a clients existing code in order to improve semantics and accessability. The original website was functional, however, it was composed mostly of nested div tags making it difficult for screen readers and search engines to parse correctly. In addition to altering tags to the semantically correct choices I also consolidated redundant code in the CSS file and added comments throghout both the HTML and the CSS files to make the site easier to maintain.

## Conclusion
Through this project I was able to:

- Explore and Learn about semantic HTML
- Begin considering basic accessabilites needs of users and learn basic techniques for how to accomodate them.
- Learn the importance of quality README files for sharing code.
